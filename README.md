## RideApp Microservices â€“ API Endpoint Overview

This project follows a microservices architecture with the following main services:

- **API Gateway**
- **User Services**
- **Captain Services**
- **Ride Services**
- **Map Services**

### How Endpoints Are Structured

Each microservice exposes its own REST API endpoints. The **API Gateway** acts as the single entry point, routing requests to the appropriate service.

A typical endpoint pattern is:
```
http://:/api//
```

### How to Find the Exact Endpoints

- **Check each microservice folder** (`user-services`, `captain-services`, `ride-services`, `map-services`) for route/controller files.
- **Review the API Gateway** (`api-gateway` folder) for route definitions and proxy logic.

## Example API Gateway Usage

Suppose your API Gateway runs at `http://localhost:3000`:

- Register User:  
  `POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/register`
- Book Ride:  
  `POST http://localhost:3000/api/ride/book`
- Get Fare Estimate:  
  `POST http://localhost:3000/api/map/fare-estimate`
